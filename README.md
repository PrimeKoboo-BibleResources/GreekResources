#   readme

This is a collection of resources for dealing with biblical texts in
Greek, specifically the Septuagint.
Due to the restrictive nature of the CCAT license, the actual text
of the Septuagint may be downloaded from the CCAT website
[here](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/lxxmorph/).

##  Resources

-   LxxLemmas: This directory contains our work on correcting and
    restructuring the lemmas of the Septuagint. It has its own readme.
-   LxxFileNames.txt is a tab-separated list mapping the CCAT file names
    to the corresponding SBL abbreviations, used in our lemma files.
-   GreekWordList.js is a compilation of Greek words from the New
    Testament and the Septuagint, meant to be used as an index to related
    dictionaries and lexica.
-	GreekWordList.md contains fuller documentation for the Greek Word
	List.
-	gntLookups.js maps the lemmas of the [MorphGNT][1] to the keys of
	the Greek word list.
-	gwl2AsLookups.js maps the Greek word list to the keys of the
	[Abbott-Smith][2] lexicon.
