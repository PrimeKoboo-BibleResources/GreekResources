The Greek Word List app allows you to look up words in the Greek Word
List. Basic instructions are given on the page:

-	Enter a word list ID or Strong number in the text box.

-	Word list IDs are unaccented Greek words.

-	You can type them in the text box, using the key map pictured below.

-	When the word you want appears in the list, you can click it.

-	Links labeled Perseus: will open Perseus to that word.

This should cover mst ordinary situations. If you enter a word that is
not in the word list, the selection list will show the closest word
before it and the next 9 entries after that. You can click on the
closest match.

If you click a Perseus link, and it fails to connect, you can copy the
Betacode form of the word, go to Perseus, using the link in the
navigation bar, and enter the Betacode directly, to search for the word.

The key map at the bottom of the page is simply an illustration,
indicating where the Greek letters are located on the standard keyboard.
When you type them into the text box, the app will convert the letters
into Greek.

The Back and Forward buttons are connected to a history of the entries
you have already chosen. When it reaches the end of the histoory, it
will just choose the previous or next entry in the word list. Sometimes
the history will get caught in a loop and get stuck. If that becomes
annoying, simply refresh the page and start over.
